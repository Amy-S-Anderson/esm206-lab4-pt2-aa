```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

First I'll attach my packages
```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(DT)
```
Here I'll use the iris data set to create an interactive graph:

```{r}

iris_graph <- ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = Sepal.Width,
                 color = Species)) +
  labs(x = "Petal width (cm)",
       y = "Petal length (cm)",
       title = "Iris metrics")

iris_graph

# make this interactive
ggplotly(iris_graph)


```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
